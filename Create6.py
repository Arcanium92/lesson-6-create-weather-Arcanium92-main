#This is your starter file for the Creating a Weather App project
#The lines that start with a # are comments and will not show up in your code
#You should utilize this feature to leave notes about what variables are for
#And what operations your code is performing

#Try to have your program be inutitive for the user to interact with
#To help you get started, here are some components and a general outline for the program

#Import Libraries
import requests
#If you have an error when importing this library try running the below line in your terminal/command window (without the #
